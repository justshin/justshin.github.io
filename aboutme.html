      <div class = "aboutme">
        <p>Hi, my name is Justin Shin. I am a 4th year at UC<br>
           Berkeley majoring in Data Science (emphasis in Business) <br>
           and obtaining a Certifcation of Enteurpeurship and Technology.<br>
           I enjoy working on projects with customer/marketing data <br>
           and have strong interests in working for tech or healthcare. <br>
           A fun fact about me is that having grown up moving 14 times and <br>
           living in 4 different countries, I had the privilege to be a part of <br>
           multiple communities/cultures and am forunate to make many <br>
           valuable connections throughout my life.<br>
           You can check out my photography tab to see some places I <br>
           have visited/lived in. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "study">
        <p>Besides studying data science, I have a strong interest<br>
          in web designing. This website was made extensively with <br>
          my knowledge in front-end web development. Currently,<br>
          I have been working as a student advisor at the UC Berkeley<br>
          Office of Undergraduate Admissions assisting incoming<br>
          students/parents and specializing in customer service.<br>
          I am also a member of the Data Analytics Team for the <br>
          UC Berkeley Division of Data Science. Through this <br>
          organization, I am exposed to working on various projects<br>
          of my interests and a network of people who are also interested<br>         
          in working with data.<br>          
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "care">
        <p>Most of my volunteer/community work focuses on the<br>
           environment and helping children. Since high school, I have worked<br>
           on amazing projects in serving the many communities I lived in as<br>
           well as working as a volunteer for children programs.<br>
           My most recent volunteer work is with the Berkeley <br>
           Project, which is a non-profit organization at UC <br>
           Berkeley that serves/cleans the Berkeley Community every semester. <br>
           I have worked as a site leader numerous times for the program <br>
           since freshman year. I have also spent time during<br>
           school breaks helping out at the American Cross Association working <br>
           with government contractors/employees on military bases in roles <br>
           related to data in healthcare. Volunteering allows me another <br>
           opportunity to give back to society besides the work I conduct with data <br>
           and gives more meaning to my life knowing I am making a difference <br>
           with/to others. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "sport">
          <p>During my free time, I like to spend time <br>
            with my family/friends, work out, play basketball <br>
            for my club team, and travel. <br>
            I also dabble a bit in stock trading analysis <br>
            and enjoy learning more about real estate <br>
            with whatever time I have left in the day. <br>
