      <div class = "aboutme">
        <p>Hi, my name is Justin Shin! I'm a current 2nd year at UC<br>
           Berkeley majoring in Data Science (emphasis in Economics) <br>
           and minoring in Computer Science.<br>
           Having grown up living in 12 states and 3 <br>
           different countries, I had the privilege to be a part of <br>
           multiple communities/cultures and enjoyed making many <br>
           valuable connections throughout my life.<br>
           Moving almost every year was one of the main reasons why I <br>
           appreciate traveling and photography.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "study">
        <p>Besides studying data science, I have a strong interest<br>
          in web designing. This website was made extensively with <br>
          my knowledge in front-end web development. Currently,<br>
          I have been working as a student advisor at the UC Berkeley<br>
          Office of Undergraduate Admissions assisting incoming<br>
          students/parents and specializing in customer service.<br>
          I am also a member of the Data Analytics Team for the <br>
          UC Berkeley Division of Data Science. Through this <br>
          organization, I am exposed to working on various projects<br>
          of my interests and a network of people who are also interested<br>         
          in working with data.<br>          
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "care">
        <p>Most of my volunteer/community work focuses on the<br>
           environment and children. Since high school, I have worked<br>
           on countless projects in serving communities as<br>
           well as working as a volunteer for children programs.<br>
           Currently, I have been working with the Berkeley <br>
           Project, which is a non-profit organization at UC <br>
           Berkeley that serves the Berkeley community every<br>
           semester. I have worked as a site leader for the program <br>
           since freshman year. I have also spend much of time during<br>
           breaks helping out at the American Cross Association working <br>
           with government contractors/employees on military bases in roles <br>
           related to data in healthcare.           
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "sport">
          <p>During my free time in college, I spend a <br>
            lot of time either working out or playing <br>
            basketball for my club team. <br>
            I also dabble a bit in trading analysis <br>
            with whatever time I have left in the day.
