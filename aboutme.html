      <div class = "aboutme">
        <p>Hi, my name is Justin Shin! I'm a current 2nd year at UC<br>
           Berkeley double majoring in Data Science and Economics.<br>
           Having grown up living in roughly 12 states and 3 <br>
           different countries,I have been exposed to many different  <br>
           cultures and valuable connections throughout my life.<br>
           Moving almost every year was one of the main reasons why I <br>
           appreciate traveling and photography(check out <br>
           photography to see more!).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "study">
        <p>Besides studying data science and economics,<br>
          I have strong interests in web design and mobile app<br>
          development. This website was made extensively with my <br>
          knowledge in html,css, and javascript.<br>
          Currently, I am working as a student<br>
          advisor at the UC Berkeley Office of Undergraduate<br>
          Admissions assisting incoming students/parents one-on-one<br>
          and specializing in customer service. I am also working as<br>
          a freelance web developer/designer and in the process<br>
          of making a brand new social media platform.<br>
          In the future, I plan on working in the sport-tech industry.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "care">
        <p>Most of my volunteer/community work focus on the<br>
           environment and children. Since high school, I have worked<br>
           on countless projects regarding serving communities as<br>
           well as working as a volunteer for children programs.<br>
           Currently, I have been working with the Berkeley <br>
           Project, which is a non-profit organization at UC <br>
           Berkeley that serves the Berkeley community every<br>
           semester. I have worked as a site leader (leading over <br>
           several dozen volunteers) for the program since coming in as<br>
           a freshman and plan on continuing this tradition throughout<br>
           my undergraduate year.

      <div class = "sport">
          <p>I am a member of the Data Science Society <br>
          at UC Berkeley. Through this club, I am exposed<br>
          to various projects as well as a network of<br>
          connections of people who are also interested in <br>
          working with data science.<br>
          Most of my work in data science involve sport<br>
          analytics, especially pertaining to basketball<br>
          analysis.
