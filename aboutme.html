      <div class = "aboutme">
        <p>Hi, my name is Justin Shin! I'm a current 2nd year at UC<br>
           Berkeley double majoring in Data Science and Economics.<br>
           Ever since I was young, I always knew that my life was <br>
           very different from other's around me; having grown up with<br>
           a military family, I lived in roughly 12 states and<br>
           3 different countries throughout my life and have been <br>
           exposed to many different cultures and valuable connections.<br>
           Moving almost every year was one of the main reasons why I <br>
           appreciate traveling and photography(check out <br>
           photography to see more!).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "study">
        <p>Besides academics in both data science and economics,<br>
          I have strong interests in web design and mobile app<br>
          development. This website was made extensively with my <br>
          knowledge in html,css, and javascript. (To look at other<br>
          projects I have worked on, check out the resume/project<br>
          tab to see more). Currently, I am working as a student<br>
          advisor at the main UC Berkeley Office of Undergraduate<br>
          Admissions assisting incoming students/parents one-on-one<br>
          and specializing in customer service. I am also working as<br>
          a freelance web developer/designer and in the process<br>
          of making a brand new social media platform (more coming soon).<br>
          In the future, some of my other dreams are to open up a high <br>
          end restaurant somewhere in the seattle area due to my love <br>
          of cooking/food as well as working in the tech sports industry.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "care">
        <p>Most of my volunteer/community work focus on the<br>
           environment and children. Since high school, I have<br>
           worked on countless projects regarding serving<br>
           communities as well as working as a volunteer for<br>
           children programs. Currently, I have been working<br>
           with the Berkeley Project, which is a non-profit<br>
           organization at UC Berkeley that serves the Berkeley<br>
           community every semester. I have worked as a site leader<br>
           (leading over several dozen volunteers) for the program<br>
           since coming in as a freshman and plan on continuing<br>
           this tradition throughout my undergraduate year.

      <div class = "sport">
        <p>I am an active member of the Data Science Society at<br>
          UC Berkeley. Through this club, I am exposed to<br>
          various projects as well as a network of connections<br>
          of people who are also interested in working with<br>
          data science. Most of my work in data science<br>
          involve sport analytics, especially pertaining to<br>
          basketball analysis. I also play for the Men's Korean<br>
          basketball team at UC Berkeley, which won first place <br>
          at the UC tournament this past spring.
