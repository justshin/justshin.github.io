      <div class = "aboutme">
        <p>Hi, my name is Justin Shin. I am a 4th year at UC<br>
           Berkeley majoring in Data Science (emphasis in Business) <br>
           and obtaining a Certifcation of Enteurpeurship and Technology.<br>
           I have a strong interest in working for the tech or healthcare <br>
           industry. A fun fact about me is that having grown up moving <br>
           14 times and living in 4 different countries, I had the <br>
           privilege to be a part of numerous communities/cultures and am <br>
           forunate to have met many valuable connections throughout my life. <br>
           Check out my photography tab to see some of the places I <br>
           have visited/lived in. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "study">
        <p>Besides studying data science, I have a strong interest<br>
          in web designing. This website was made extensively with <br>
          my knowledge in front-end web development.<br>
          For this upcoming summer, I will be interning at Samsung Electronics <br>
          working with customer/market data insight.<br>
          I have previously worked as a student advisor at the UC Berkeley<br>
          Office of Undergraduate Admissions assisting incoming<br>
          students/parents and specializing in customer service.<br>
          I am also a member of the Data Analytics Team for the <br>
          UC Berkeley Division of Data Science. Through this <br>
          organization, I am exposed to working on various projects<br>
          of my interests and a network of peers who also have a passion <br>
          for data science.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "care">
        <p>Most of my volunteer/community work focuses on helping the <br>
           environment and children. Since high school, I have worked<br>
           on several projects serving the many communities I lived in as<br>
           well as working as a volunteer for children educational programs.<br>
           My most recent volunteer work is with the Berkeley <br>
           Project, which is a non-profit organization at UC <br>
           Berkeley that assist the Berkeley Community every semester. <br>
           I have worked as a site leader numerous times for the program <br>
           since freshman year. I have also spent time during<br>
           school breaks helping out at the American Cross Association working <br>
           with government contractors/employees on a military base in roles <br>
           related to data in healthcare. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "sport">
          <p>During my free time, I like to spend time <br>
            with my family/friends, working out, playing basketball <br>
            for my club team, and traveling. I am currently in the process <br>
            of learning/obtaining an AWS Solutions Architect Certification in <br>
            my spare time as well. I also dabble a bit in stock <br>
            trading analysis and enjoy learning about <br>
            real estate with whatever time I have left in the day.
