        Welcome to my personal website. My name is Justin Shin, a <br>
        current 2nd year at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science and <br>
        Economics. Ever since I was young, I always knew that the my <br>
        life was very different from others around me. Living in over 12 <br>
        different states and 3 countries throughout my life, I've always <br>
        strived to explore/learn as much as I could of the world around me. <br>
        Besides having interests in sports analytics and academics, I enjoy <br>
        doing photography as well as playing basketball during my spare <br>
        time. I also enjoy all sorts of cuisines and have no fear in trying <br>
        out unique foods from around the world.  Check out my <br>
        blog/photography to learn more about my travels or click on my <br>
        resume/projects to see some of the projects I have worked on <br>
        during my professional academic career!
